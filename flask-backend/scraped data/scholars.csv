1,Abdussalam Alawini,"I am a teaching assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are broadly in the field of databases, with a focus on data management. I am particularly interested in applying machine learning methods to various problems of modern data management systems. I am also interested in CS education research.",University of Tripoli,2002,Portland State University,2011,Portland State University,2016,Data Provenance,Data Citation,Computers and Education,CS411: Database Systems,,
2,Jeff Erickson,"I'm a computational geometer/topologist/graphophile with more general interests in algorithms, data structures, and lower bounds. I have the lowest undergraduate GPA (2.4/4.0) of any professor I've ever met, although some of my colleagues came close, and a few others never finished college at all. (I really shouldn't be proud of that.) Only three other professors have been in my department longer than I have. (I really shouldn't be proud of that, either.) I teach mostly large algorithms classes; you might find my free textbook and other course materials useful. From 2013 to 2016, I was an associate department head and chair of the faculty recruiting committee. I am a SafeTOC advocate.",Rice University,1987,"University of California, Irvine",1992,"University of California, Berkeley",1996,Algorithms,Data Structures,Computational Geometry,CS374: Algorithms and Model of Computation,CS473: Algorithms,
